# machine-learning-challenge

I ran different models (testing models.ipynb) to verify model's performance for three classifier models. I tested SVC, logistic regression, and random forest.

SCV results: Training Data Score: 0.8617
             Testing Data Score: 0.8667

logistic regression results:
              Training Data Score: 0.8870
              Testing Data Score: 0.8947
random forest results: 
              Training Data Score: 0.9784
              Testing Data Score: 0.8998
              
I found that for the given data random forest was the best model.

I decided to go a little bit further and I checked with parameters were not needed on the model (check_random_forest.ipynb). 

Then I removed unnecessary features and checked once again the performance of random forest (model_3_randomForest.ipynb). 
Final results: 
        Training Data Score: 1.0
        Testing Data Score: 0.8987
